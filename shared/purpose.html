<p>Lets face it, technical interviews for a tech related role can be challenging. It ranges from whiteboard algorithms to pair programming and live coding challenges. It tests both the candidates' communication skills as well as their problem solving abilities. Often times, the candidate will probably not be performing at a 100% during the interview process.</p>
<p>Now, imagine yourself in a room with 1-4 senior software engineers, all staring at you intently as you tackle the problem at hand. It could be a fairly complicated one or it could even be a more straightforward problem that you've probably done before in the past. A couple of things could go wrong here:  your mind goes blank, or you're not really able to think sequentially and calmly or your solution runs into a lot of bugs and you begin to panic. We've all been there and its not fun.</p>
<p>Thats why I decided to create this group as a support community for local developers in Malaysia(or even any where) to come together and help prepare one another through mock technical interviews. Its a completely free service where everyone has an opportunity to give back and best of all, its a risk free environment to practise, learn and grow!</p>
